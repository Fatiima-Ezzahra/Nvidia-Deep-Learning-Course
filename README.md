# Nvidia Deep Learning Course

The course **Getting Started with Deep Learning** is an introduction Deep Learning, its history, and its various applications such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, etc.

## Mini-Projects :

* **[Image Classification with the MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/Fatiima-Ezzahra/Nvidia-Deep-Learning-Course/blob/main/01_mnist.ipynb)** : "Hello World" of deep learning, training a deep learning model to correctly classify hand-written digits.

* **[Image Classification of an American Sign Language Dataset](https://github.com/Fatiima-Ezzahra/Nvidia-Deep-Learning-Course/blob/main/02_asl.ipynb)** : Perform data preparation, model creation, and model training using a different dataset: images of hands making letters in American Sign Language.

* **[Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/Fatiima-Ezzahra/Nvidia-Deep-Learning-Course/blob/main/03_asl_cnn.ipynb)** : Introduction to a popular kind of model called a convolutional neural network that is especially good for reading images and classifying them.

* **[Data Augmentation](https://github.com/Fatiima-Ezzahra/Nvidia-Deep-Learning-Course/blob/main/04a_asl_augmentation.ipynb)** : Learn how to avoid overfitting using Data Augmentation.

* **[Deploying Your Model](https://github.com/Fatiima-Ezzahra/Nvidia-Deep-Learning-Course/blob/main/04b_asl_predictions.ipynb)** : Expose new images to our model and detect the correct letters of the sign language alphabet.

* **[Pre-Trained Models](https://github.com/Fatiima-Ezzahra/Nvidia-Deep-Learning-Course/blob/main/05a_doggy_door.ipynb)** : Explore available models such as VGG.

* **[Transfer Learning](https://github.com/Fatiima-Ezzahra/Nvidia-Deep-Learning-Course/blob/main/05b_presidential_doggy_door.ipynb)** : Use Transfer Learning to create a doggy door that only lets in a particular dog.

* **[Generate Headlines](https://github.com/Fatiima-Ezzahra/Nvidia-Deep-Learning-Course/blob/main/06_headline_generator.ipynb)** : Use Recurrent Neural Networks to generate new headlines.

* **[Assessment](https://github.com/Fatiima-Ezzahra/Nvidia-Deep-Learning-Course/blob/main/07_assessment.ipynb)** : Train a new model that is able to recognize fresh and rotten fruite using some combination of transfer learning, data augmentation, and fine tuning.
